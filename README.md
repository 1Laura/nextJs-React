# nextJs-React

This repository currently contains only this README. There are no source files or configuration files yet. The project name suggests it may be intended for a Next.js + React application, but this cannot be confirmed from the current contents.

If you are the maintainer, please update the sections marked TODO with the accurate details once code and configuration are added.

## Overview
- Purpose: TODO — briefly describe what this project does and who it’s for.
- Status: Initial scaffold. No implementation files are present yet.

## Tech Stack
Detected from repository: None (no code files present).

Likely (based on repository name only — unconfirmed):
- React
- Next.js
- Node.js runtime

TODO — Confirm the actual stack and versions once the project code is added (e.g., Next.js version, React version, TypeScript or JavaScript, CSS framework, etc.).

## Requirements
Currently unknown. If this is a Next.js/React app, typical requirements would include:
- Node.js (LTS recommended, e.g., 18.x or newer) — TODO confirm version
- A package manager (npm, Yarn, pnpm, or bun) — TODO confirm which one

Optional tools (if applicable):
- TypeScript — TODO confirm
- ESLint/Prettier — TODO confirm

## Setup
Because no code or package.json is present, setup steps are not available yet. Below are placeholders depending on the chosen package manager.

- npm:
  - TODO — run `npm install`
- Yarn:
  - TODO — run `yarn install`
- pnpm:
  - TODO — run `pnpm install`
- bun:
  - TODO — run `bun install`

## Running the app
No runnable entry points detected yet. After scripts exist in package.json, typical commands might be:

- Development server (example):
  - npm: `npm run dev`
  - Yarn: `yarn dev`
  - pnpm: `pnpm dev`
  - bun: `bun run dev`

- Production build (example):
  - npm: `npm run build`
  - Yarn: `yarn build`
  - pnpm: `pnpm build`
  - bun: `bun run build`

- Start production server (example):
  - npm: `npm run start`
  - Yarn: `yarn start`
  - pnpm: `pnpm start`
  - bun: `bun run start`

TODO — Replace with actual commands once scripts are defined.

## Scripts
No scripts detected. The repository does not include a package.json.

TODO — Add scripts after initializing the project. Common scripts for a Next.js project:
- `dev` — start the development server
- `build` — build the application for production
- `start` — start the production server
- `lint` — run linting
- `test` — run tests

## Environment Variables
No environment variables detected. If using Next.js or similar, you might need `.env.local` or `.env` files. Examples:

- TODO — `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://example.com/api`
- TODO — `DATABASE_URL=...`
- TODO — `NODE_ENV=development`

Document each variable:
- Name
- Description
- Required? (Yes/No)
- Default value

## Entry Points
None detected. There is no application code yet.

For a Next.js app, typical entry points include:
- `next.config.js` (framework configuration)
- `app/` or `pages/` directory (routing and page entry points)

TODO — Document the actual entry points once code is added.

## Tests
No tests detected.

TODO — Add a test setup. Examples:
- Jest + React Testing Library
- Vitest + Testing Library
- Playwright or Cypress for E2E

Typical commands (to be added later):
- `test` — run tests
- `test:watch` — watch mode
- `test:coverage` — coverage report
